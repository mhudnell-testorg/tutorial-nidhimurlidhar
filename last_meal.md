The name "green" curry derives from the color of the dish, which comes from green chillies.[1] The "sweet" in the Thai name (wan means "sweet") refers to the particular color green itself and not to the taste of the curry.[2] As this is a Thai curry based on coconut milk and fresh green chillies, the color comes out creamy mild green or, as this color is called in Thai, "sweet green". Its ingredients are not exactly fixed. The curry is not necessarily sweeter than other Thai curries but, although the spiciness varies, it tends to be more pungent than the milder red curries.[3] Green curry was invented during the reign of King Rama 6 or Rama 7, between the years 1908-1926.[4]
